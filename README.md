Personal Shopping Assistant
===
http://a3-eos7l.glitch.me

This is a proof-of-concept shopping assistance web application that help consumers to find the best deals and best retailer to purchase with. 

To fulfill the requirements:
---
### Five Express Packages:
- Body-parser
- Passport-local
- Compress-file
- Server-static
- Helmet 

### Authentication Strategy & Database: 

- I used passport for authentication and lowDB as my database storage. 

### HTML:

- I have a total of 5 different HTML pages. 

### CSS Framework:

- I used the framework found on templemag. The original template can be found here: https://templatemag.com/demo/Mineem/
- I chose it because I love its simplistic style with the white background. 


Goals:
---
- This application serves as a personal shopping assistant to make the shopping experience smoother and all related items more organized. It is also a proof-of-concept website which can easily turn into something huge.
- It allows users to add items which they want to monitor the price of. In the ideal world, the user will be able to receive updates once the price is dropped (*in the imaginary world). This is meant for only one logged-in user to see. 
- Ideally, it should allow users to post deals/discounts/unused coupons whenever they find one online. The deals are auto-generated to be posted on the main page and can be seen by all including guest users. 


Main Challenges:
---
- Since I have multiple HTML pages, storing the current user's information took me a while to figure out. I tried both local storage and document.cookie and it seems like the local storage method is more staple. 
- There were actually more documentation online for how to do Mongo and I feel like I should have used Mongo, particularly many answers could be found online for passport-Mongo. I implemented a register method but was never able to make it work.

Implications:

Achievements:
---
This is entirely different from what I built for A2 so none of the achievements are repeats from last name. 
### Technical:
- Implemented a logout (can be found in the pushdown menu inside account tab)
- You can register an account
    - I have pre-created an account that has the username "admin" and passsword "CS4241" for you to see some dummy values I used to intialize the dataset.
    


### Design:
- Used the following libraries:
    - Typeit.js
    
- Animated checkbox?
- Learned how to make right-aligned items in the list using the attribute direction
- The original CSS template is not meant to be used for any business so I made a lot of changes to the page in order to fit the content well.
